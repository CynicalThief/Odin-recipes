        <h2><strong><em>"This chicken make my wee wee go bang bang!"</em></strong> - Said the man with the wee wee that went bang bang.</h2>
        <p>This bang bang chicken is a <em>wonderful</em> Americanized version of an extremely popular Sichuan Chinese dish. With twice-fried chicken, you get the crispy fried breading you'd expect, and the bang bang sauce drizzle makes the entire dish spectacular. You'll love this more than any restaurant version. Pay attention to the notes in the directions.</p>

        <h3>Directions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Step 1: Whisk together milk and egg in a large bowl until well combined. Add chicken; stir to coat and allow to marinate for 15 minutes. Drain and discard egg mixture.</li>
            <li>Step 2: Combine potato starch, flour, salt, pepper, and shichimi in a medium bowl. Pour into a large plastic resealable bag. Add chicken; seal the bag and shake until chicken is well coated.</li>
            <li>Step 3: Heat 2 inches oil in a deep saucepan over medium heat to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Working in batches of about 5 to 8 pieces at a time, cook chicken in hot oil for about 90 seconds. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate; keep each batch separate.</li>
            <li>Step 4: Increase oil temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). The oil should be continuously boiling at this point. Carefully re-add the first batch of chicken and fry for another 90 seconds.</li>
            <li>Step 5: Remove to another paper towel-lined plate. Repeat with remaining batches of chicken.</li>
            <li>Step 6: Mix together mayonnaise, honey, sweet chili sauce, and gochujang in a large serving bowl until combined.</li>
            <li>Step 7: Toss fried chicken with sauce to coat. Serve and enjoy!</li>
